 AI STOCK PREDICTOR - README
===============================

PROJECT NAME:
-------------
AI Stock Predictor

DESCRIPTION:
------------
AI Stock Predictor is a machine learning-based application that uses historical stock market data to predict future stock prices. The model is trained using deep learning techniques such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, which are well-suited for time-series forecasting.

FEATURES:
---------
✔ Predict future stock prices using historical data  
✔ Interactive visualization of stock trends  
✔ Streamlit-based user interface for ease of use  
✔ Supports multiple stock tickers (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, TSLA)  
✔ Download prediction results as CSV  

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- yfinance
- streamlit

INSTALLATION:
-------------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-stock-predictor.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd ai-stock-predictor

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  (Linux/Mac) or venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)

4. Install required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

USAGE:
------
1. Run the Streamlit app:
   streamlit run app.py

2. Enter a stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL) and the number of days to forecast

3. View the predicted graph and metrics on the web interface
